# In this mini-project:  
I am creating a basic fully functional calculator with the best possble gui interface.

<h4>This is only for my own reference:</h4>  
In the index.html file, From line no <b>16</b> to line no <b>40</b>. (7:09 to 7:16),  
I have noted that as many div container classes that we created, rows are created.  
matlab ki jitni baar ham div daal rhe hai utni baar he ye next wali line pe jaa rhi hai  
islie div ko <b>block-level element</b> kha jaata hai  

<h3>The two axes of flexbox</h3>
When working with <b>flexbox</b> you need to think in terms of two axes â€” the <b>main axis</b> and the <b>cross axis</b>.  
The <i>main axis</i> is defined by the <b><i>flex-direction property</i></b>,   
and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth understanding how they work from the outset.
