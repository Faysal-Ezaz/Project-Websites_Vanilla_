# In this mini-project:  
I am creating a basic fully functional calculator with the best possble gui interface.

<h4>This is only for my own reference:</h4>  
In the index.html file, From line no <b>16</b> to line no <b>40</b>. (7:09 to 7:16),  
I have noted that as many div container classes that we created, rows are created.  
matlab ki jitni baar ham div daal rhe hai utni baar he ye next wali line pe jaa rhi hai  
islie div ko <b>block-level element</b> kha jaata hai
