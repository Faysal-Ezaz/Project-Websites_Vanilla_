## The reason behind building out the project: 
This project is built using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS.  
I have been learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a few days now and wanted to put my skills to the test.  
So this is me trying to build up a project from scratch using the basics of Web Development.
