# This is a simple Weather Web App. 
In this application, I will be working on the following: 
<ul>
    <li>Working with API's.
        <ul>
            <li>I will be pulling data from the API.</li>
            <li>The pulled data will be injected in the page</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Working with the time zone.</li>
    <li>Working with the Temperature
        <ul>
            <li>By default, the Farhenheit will be displayed, and on clicking,</li> 
            <li>The Temp in Celsius will be displayed.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>A cool SVG will be included that shows whats actually going on outside.</li>
</ul>
